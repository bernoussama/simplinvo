Where Simplicity meets Speed

## Why Simplinvo?
Most small/medium size business use excel-based apps, to track their invoices, they get the job done, but they’re not robust and easy to break and if you don’t have a backup, and the ultimate weakness is sharing the excel file between multiple users it can be a nightmare.
Web-based solutions solving this problem exists, but they’re often over-engineered and bloated with useless features for small businesses, that’s why they stick with excel.
Simplinvo is here to solve this mess.

## What is Simplinvo
Simplinvo is a new invoicing app designed to simplify invoice and quote generation for small to medium-sized businesses.
It offers comprehensive invoicing, enhanced efficiency, and improved user experience.
The tech stack includes Sqlite, Go(PocketBase), and React(Remix).
